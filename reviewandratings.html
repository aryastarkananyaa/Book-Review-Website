    <h2 class="boxo"><u>THE SECRET</u>--By<i>  Rohnda Byrne</i></h2>
    <p>
        <img src="fofo (1).jpg" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="200" hspace="10">
        <b>GENRE: SELF HELP</b><br> There has been too much hype about this book which made me pick it and I'm definitely not regretting. 'The Secret', is a wonderful effort done in discussing The law of attraction, a law according to which you attract
        the circumstances and experiences you go through, good or bad, be it in family, career, relationships or desires in general. To put it in simpler terms, it brings forth the universe as a wish granting factory which focussing on the energies you
        exhale, says "Your wish is my command", as described beautifully by the author. The law of attraction is a debatable issue and there's a lot left to discuss and argue about the same. Imagine somebody telling you that you can better your relationship
        or get your dream car by merely thinking or meditating about it, well that raises eyebrows. But there's another level on which this book functions. When it enlightens the readers about the authority they hold over their lives and circumstances,
        they are bound to be more positive and confident. They experience a power within themselves and this itself is a commendable task in itself which this book does. Overall, its a must read to widen your horizon of understanding of yourself and the
        universe but as any self help book, it won't work if you don't practice.

    <h2 class="boxo"><u>THE BOOK THIEF</u>--By<i> MARKUS ZUSAK</i></h2>
    <p>
        <img src="fofo (5).jpg" align="left" border="1" height="200" width="200" hspace="10">
        <b><u>GENRE:</u> HISTORICAL,DRAMA</b> <br><br> The first and the only book that has ever managed to make me cry so much like this.s a person who doesnt find history intriguing, with this book, I found myself entangled within the social hierarchy
        of the Nazi period and felt deeply moved by the history of Germany for the first time. The Book Thief is indeed a spectacular portrayal of the Nazi Germany in history during The Second World War This is the story of Liesel Meminger, who comes
        to live with her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann at a time when Hitler was rising to power. Their lives are threatened when a Jew named Max Vandenberg turns up in their house asking for help. The Hubermanns agree to shelter him in their
        basement, and hence begins the friendship between Liesel and Max. Beautiful and heartbreaking, this book is not for those who prefer straightforward linear narratives. But if you love words, read it if you haven't already.

    <h2 class="boxo"><u> THE WIND -UP BIRD CHRONICLE</u>-- By<i>  Haruki Murakami</i></h2>
    <p>
        <img src="fofo (4).jpg" align="left" border="1" height="200" width="200" hspace="10">
        <b><u>GENRE:</u>MAGICAL REALISM,SUSPENSE</b> <br><br> I Don't know whether I can make this review as objective as possible because I'm really a fan of Haruki Murakami. This is the fourth book I read and I really addicted to his writing style,
        story plot, and such. All books I read so far is basically combined 2-3 different dimensions that connected to each other, and this book is no exception. The Wind-up Bird Chronicle is about a married man, Toru Okada who's looking for the mystery
        about his wife, Kumiko Okada who's suddenly disappeared. Kumiko doesn't give him any hints, but what he believes until the end is Kumiko trying to send him message as looking for help. Starting from the disappeared of the cat they're raised from
        the beginning of their marriage, the blocked alley behind their house, the vacant house that always give bad luck to whoever's live there, and several new peoples coming to their live. The plot is sometimes jump from one to another. This book
        combined back to the history of Japanese war in Manchukuo, the secret mission that only served 4 soldiers to the border of Siberia, and the cruelty of Russian soldiers after the defeated of Japanese as US dropped bomb to Hiroshima in 1945. The
        Wind-up Chronicle is actually about the sound of the bird that only can be hear of several people, those be able to move to another dimension as they sleep. All the plotlines are mixed up and confusing in a good way, all the mysteries aren't going
        to give you any hint, but to follow the path as you read this book. 606 pages give the exact amount of satisfaction for me.

    <h2 class="boxo"><u> THE MUSEUM OF INNOCENCE</u>-- By<i> Orhan Pamuk</i></h2>
    <p>
        <img src="fofo (9).jpg" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="200" hspace="10">
        <b><u>GENRE:</u>ROMANCE,DRAMA</b> <br><br> The Museum of innocence by Orhan Pamuk. The only novel that made me cry, re-read some of the chapters and will make me think of the characters for days to come (I know this) It is beautiful and heartbreaking
        at the same time. I haven’t read such a fine novel in a long, long time! I can hardly believe that it’s a translation . Recommended only for the old souls. The museum of innocence definitely an exhibit in my museum. An excerpt from the novel:<br><br>
        <i>
"After closing the door to the bathroom on the top floor, I decided that my life was no longer in my control, that my connection to Füsun had shaped it into something beyond my free will. Only by believing this could I be happy, could I indeed bear to live.
 On the little tray before the mirror bearing Füsun’s, Aunt Nesibe’s, and Uncle Tarik’s toorhbrushes, as well as shaving soap, brush, and razor, I saw Füsun’s lipstick. I picked it up and sniffed it, then put it in my pocket. 
 I efficiently sniffed the towels hanging on the rack but detected nothing as I remembered it: Clean ones had evidently been put out in expectation of my visit. As I surveyed the small toilet, searching for one other object that 
 might offer me consolation during the difficult days awaiting me after I’d left this place, I saw myself in the mirror, and from my expression I had a shocking intimation of the rift between my body and my soul. Whereas my face was drained by defeat and shock,
  inside my head was another universe: I now understood as an element fact of life that while I was here, inside my body was a soul, a meaning, that all things were made of desire, touch, and love, that what I was suffering was composed of the same elements.
   Between the howling of the rain and the gurgling of the water pipes, I heard one of the old Turkish songs that, in my childhood, would make my grandmother so happy whenever she heard it. There had to be a radio nearby. 
   Between the low moan of the lute and the joyous chatter of the kanun was a tired but hopeful female voice, coming to me through the bathroom’s half-open window, saying, “It’s love, it’s love, the reason for everything in the universe.”</i>

    <h2 class="boxo"><u> SAPIENS: A Brief History Of Humankind</u>-- By<i> Yuval Noah Harari</i></h2>
    <p>
        <img src="fofo (3).jpg" align="left" f border="1" height="200" width="200" hspace="10">
        <b><u>GENRE:</u>EDUCATIONAL</b> <br><br> I was very disappointed in parts of this book. It starts out well-- the overview of human-prehistory is quite decent, and I learned some new things, esp. about human impacts on biodiversity. The only parts of this book that really grabbed my attention were the chapters on early humankind, and especially the interaction between Homo Sapiens and other Homo species. The rest of it is a very pedestrian and basic journey through some aspects of human history, with the author making a lot of sweeping assertions and tending towards a rather vague and disembodied explanation of things like culture, money, etc. These sort of general explanations might be good for someone new to the study of history, but the reader should beware that they don't get taken in too much by the author's often simplistic and one-sided explanation of these concepts. The unifying theme of it being "a history of humankind", focusing on Homo Sapiens as a species, often disappears and it becomes a general plod through whatever aspects of history the author is interested in. More on Homo Sapiens' relations with other species and with nature might have been good.
